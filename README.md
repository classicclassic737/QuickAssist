## 📚 Detailed Features & Usage

### Connection Process

The Quick Assist connection workflow is designed for security and simplicity:

1. **Helper Authentication** - Helper signs in with Microsoft credentials
2. **Code Generation** - System generates a unique, time-limited 6-digit code
3. **Code Sharing** - Helper shares code via phone, email, or messaging
4. **Recipient Entry** - Recipient enters code in "Get assistance" section
5. **Permission Request** - Helper requests screen sharing and/or control
6. **Access Grant** - Recipient explicitly approves each permission level
7. **Active Session** - Both parties can see connection status and duration

### Screen Sharing vs. Full Control

Quick Assist offers two levels of access:

#### View-Only Mode (Screen Sharing)
- Helper can **see** the recipient's screen
- Helper **cannot** control mouse or keyboard
- Useful for **diagnostics and guidance**
- Lower security risk, ideal for initial assessment

#### Full Control Mode
- Helper can **control** mouse, keyboard, and all inputs
- Helper can **modify files, settings, and applications**
- Requires **explicit permission** from recipient
- Necessary for hands-on troubleshooting and fixes

### Annotation and Drawing Tools

During screen sharing sessions, helpers can use annotation features:

- **Pointer Tool** - Highlight cursor for better visibility
- **Drawing Pen** - Draw freehand on the screen
- **Highlighter** - Mark specific areas in yellow
- **Eraser** - Remove annotations
- **Clear All** - Remove all drawings at once

> **Note**: Annotations are temporary and don't modify actual files

### Session Management

Both parties can monitor and control the session:

- **Timer Display** - Shows session duration in real-time
- **Pause/Resume** - Temporarily suspend control (helper side)
- **End Session** - Either party can disconnect at any time
- **Reconnect** - Generate new code for follow-up sessions

### Windows 11 Enhancements

Quick Assist received significant updates in Windows 11:

- **Redesigned Interface** - Modern, streamlined UI matching Windows 11 design
- **Laser Pointer** - Virtual pointer visible to both parties
- **Session Chat** - Text-based messaging during support sessions
